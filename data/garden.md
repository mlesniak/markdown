# Digital garden

This website follows the latest movement of [_digital gardens_](https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+garden+blog) and this site is my personal part of the Web. Joel Hooks [said](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), that the phrase

> "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

In contrast to a blog, there will be no comments and no chronological timeline. Instead you will find a lot of unfinished articles, reflections, ideas, notes and snippets which -- analogous to a real garden -- are curated, extended, sometimes even left alone for a couple of days, months and years before I continue writing. I'll use this site as the primary destination for all my notes about things I've read, seen and mused about.

 In particular I am a big fan of writing down thoughts and ideas. Through the process of forcing myself to linearize my ideas and express them explicitly -- even to myself, I get a deeper and more thorough understanding of nearly everything.
